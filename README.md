BoundedQueue
============
An implementation of a bounded queue that stores integers using arrays and floating front and end indices. This method was chosen because the problem called for the solution to be delivered in one class with no outside library calls so it was neater to use arrays. 

BoundedQueueTester tests BoundedQueue and prints the results.
